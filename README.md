# Hello! 

Welcome to my personal website (it is *always* work in progress)  
You can access it at [kaiyuanc.github.io](https://kaiyuanc.github.io/)  
If you have an idea to make it better, please let me know!  

### Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): a full stack React Web framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS

### Fun Facts

- I realize I didn't really need Next.js for this...
- I find making the content creative is the hardest part, especially when English is not your strong suit
- I have spent approx. **10** hours on making this website so far!
- This website design is inspired by [SSENSE's website](https://www.ssense.com/) and [Abdus Salam's Website](https://abdussalam.pk/)
